# Future Project Ideas

- Rate starters as well as teams (should account for injuries better)
- Implement new rating systems (Bradley Terry, Trueskill)
- Reverse engineer public data into matchup predictions to get a better idea about how accurate public predictions are
- Check to see if dynamically updating team ratings as tournament progresses helps predictions
